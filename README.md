My simple version multi-language for C#

## How to use:

1. create in folder 'Language' .txt file for new language
   example file `Italiano.txt`, where first line inside 
   must be name of language
1. inside the file structure "FormFieldName = Text"
   example string in file `btnSave = Salva`
1. the rest is clear from the code :-)
