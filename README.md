My simple version multi-language for C#

## How to use:

1. Name of Controls must be begin this 'lbl' for 'Label',
   'btn' for 'Button', 'rbt' for 'RadioButton',
   'chk' for 'CheckBox' and 'grb' for 'GroupBox'
1. create in folder 'Language' .txt file for new language
   example file `Italiano.txt`, where first line inside 
   must be name of language
1. inside the file structure "FormFieldName = Text"
   example string in file `btnSave = Salva`
1. the rest is clear from the code :-)
